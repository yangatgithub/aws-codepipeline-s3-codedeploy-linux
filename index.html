    <h1>Congratulations!</h1>
    <h2>You have successfully created a pipeline that retrieved this source application from GitHub and 
      deployed it to one Amazon EC2 instance using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. 
      Youâ€™re one step closer to practicing continuous deployment!  </h2>
    <h3> Note: You might want to clear the cache to display the update correctly </h3>
    <h4> AWS App Mesh is a service mesh based on the Envoy proxy that makes it easy to monitor and control microservices. App Mesh standardizes how your microservices communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high availability for your applications. 
App Mesh gives you consistent visibility and network traffic controls for every microservice in an application. For more information, see the App Mesh User Guide. 
This topic helps you to use AWS App Mesh with an existing microservice application running on Amazon EKS or Kubernetes on Amazon EC2. You can either integrate Kubernetes with App Mesh resources by completing the steps in this topic, or by installing the App Mesh Kubernetes integration components. The integration components automatically complete the tasks in this topic for you, enabling you to integrate with App Mesh directly from Kubernetes. For more information, see Configure App Mesh Integration with Kubernetes. </h4>
